    <h1>P1 Report</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>You will create a website for a client of your choosing. Your client could be a family member, a business, a
            student group, a friend, an online community, and so on. The only restriction is that the client cannot be
            just you. <p class="spec-description">My client is the JMU club cross country and track student
                organization.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Your content must be original and not lifted from other websites. Third-party images are acceptable provided
            you adhere to their license.<p class="spec-description">Content was given to me by the client either
                directly or taken from their current
                webiste with permission.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Your site must contain at least five separate pages, each having a meaningful purpose. One of the files
            should be named index.html, which Apache loads by default. <p class="spec-description">The site has eight
                pages: home, who we are, meet exec, covid updates, team meetings,
                merch and dues, contact us, and faqs.
                The index.html page loads automatically.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>Your site must include some sort of header. <p class="spec-description">Each page has an image and title
                header except the meet exec page which just has the
                title header.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Your site must include some sort of navigation links. <p class="spec-description">The side menu opens up and
                allows the user to navigate to each page.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Your site must support distinct layouts for large and small screens using media queries. For instance,
            multicolumn layouts on large screens should be reduced to single column layouts on small screens. <p
                class="spec-description">My site supports large and small layouts. When the screen size reduces, the
                background
                image disappears and it becomes a single column with all of the same info.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>Your site must maintain a coherent style across its pages. Repeated style rules must be placed in a shared
            stylesheet. Style rules not shared between pages must be placed in separate stylesheets. <p
                class="spec-description">My site has a consistent monocolumn layout on every page (except home).
                There is an image header and footer on each page.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>Your site must include images, and their alt attributes must adequately describe the image content to users
            of screen readers, user with images disabled, and webcrawlers. <p class="spec-description">Each image has an
                alt tag describing what's on it.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Each page must declare its favicon. <p class="spec-description">Each page has a runner emoji for it's
                favicon.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Your site’s non-HTML resources must be organized. Images must be placed in a directory named images. CSS
            files must be placed in a directory named css. JavaScript must be placed in a directory named js. <p
                class="spec-description">All non-html files are organized in the above folders.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Your site must not be built using any libraries or frameworks. Do not use Bootstrap, jQuery, React, Angular,
            Vue, or any other third-party tools. You may, however, reimplement the ideas you see in these third-party
            tools. <p class="spec-description">My site does not use any third-party tools, but I did link to
                an external style sheet from
                <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_social_media_buttons.asp">W3schools</a>
                to include social media images.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>Each page and stylesheet of your site must validate without any warnings or errors using the W3C’s Nu
            Validator. <p class="spec-description">Every page passed the Nu validator.</p>
        </li>

        <li>The content should be neatly aligned. The axes of alignment should be clearly visible. Favor left- and
            right-alignment over centering—as centering does not produce a strong axis of alignment. <p
                class="spec-description">Most of the content is left-aligned except for the home page. </p>
        </li>

        <li>Your site must use at least two different font faces. Headings are often rendered in a sans-serif font, and
            paragraph copy in a serif font. <p class="spec-description">All headings are in Montserrat (sans-serif) and
                the body text is in Lora (serif).
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>Your site must include at least one form (or informal collection of input elements). The form might submit
            data to a server or invoke some client-side JavaScript function that alters the page. The action is not
            specified. <p class="spec-description">There is a form on my contact page where the user can enter
                information to send
                to the cross country email. They can also opt to be added to the email list. This isn't hooked up on the
                backend.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>Your site must include links to external sites. <p class="spec-description">I have a few links to external
                sites, most of which are social media
                sites. The icons on the footer all link to the team's social media accounts.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>Your source code must be readable, using conventional and consistent formatting and meaningful names for
            classes and IDs. <p class="spec-description">The id's and classes names are consistent and readable.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>Your site must include at least one animation, powered either by CSS or JavaScript. <p
                class="spec-description">The side bar is animated as well as the submit button on the contact page.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Your site must be stored in a Git repository that you have shared with your instructor. On GitHub, GitLab,
            and Bitbucket, share with the user twodee. <p class="spec-description">
                https://github.com/jennahorrall/347p1.git</p>
        </li>

        <li>The names of your files must be entirely lowercase and contain only alphanumeric characters. <p
                class="spec-description">All files are lowercase and alphanumeric.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Your site must have its own domain name. <p class="spec-description">domain name: project1.jennadev.me</p>
        </li>

        <li>Your site must be served out over HTTPS on port 443. You are encouraged to use Let’s Encrypt to obtain a
            free certificate. <p class="spec-description">I used Let's Encrypt to get a free certificate.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Users who access your site over HTTP on port 80 must be automatically redirected to port 443.<p
                class="spec-description">The site is redirected to port 443.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Your Git repository should show a steady flow of commits over the course of the project. Committing and
            pushing should happen steadily, after each work session, and not just right before the due date. <p
                class="spec-description">Thoughout the project I've had about 20 commits starting on Sept. 21 up
                until the due date (today).
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>Critique from client: <p class="spec-description">This website is a huge improvement over our current
                design. The responsive side nav
                bar is both sleek and intuitive. Our current website is also very outdated, so it is nice to have
                updated
                information with a refreshing design. The background image creates the feeling of open space throughout
                the
                website and the pictures of the team add personality to each page. The color scheme is pleasant and
                inviting
                making it perfect for recruiting. My only qualm with the current site is that it doesn’t contain
                information
                on the routes that we run at practice. Having these on our site is useful so that everyone can look at
                the
                routes before we run them that day. I am sure that they can be included in the next iteration. Overall
                fantastic work!</p>
